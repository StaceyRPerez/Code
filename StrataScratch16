#Find the search details for villas and houses with wireless internet access


SELECT 
   * 
FROM 
   airbnb_search_details 
WHERE 
   amenities LIKE '%Wireless Internet%' AND 
   property_type IN ('House', 'Villa');






We can use the * in this case because the question or ask is not specifically requiring a column type of return 
they are only asking to filter so we can leave this as is.
From is straightforward
WHERE will have two different sub features so we need to join them with the AND because both need to be true
villas with wireless internet access
houses with wireless internet access
Use your first line focusing on the amenities column and use the LIKE function since you want to get a pattern and not an exact match
In this case because there is so much text to sift through LIKE is preferred over =
Similarly, we need to use the % before and after the text because in the amenitities columns there is unnecessary text before AND after that we don't want
If it was just before or just after we would use one % our next line of code then becomes amenities LIKE '%Wirelesss Internet%' AND 
The ask is also telling us we need to filter for property_type for two versions
In this example again the = function is not preferred because it only works best for ONE identifier, in this case we have 2 and to shorten 
the code we use IN, if we had 3 property types we would just add it into the parenthesis with another comma
The last line of the code becomes property_type IN ('House', 'Villa');
