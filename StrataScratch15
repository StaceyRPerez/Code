Write a query to find the weight for each shipment's earliest shipment date. Output the shipment id along with the weight.



SELECT
    a.shipment_id,
    a.weight
FROM
    amazon_shipment a
JOIN (
        SELECT
            shipment_id, 
            MIN(shipment_date) AS earliest_date
        FROM amazon_shipment
        GROUP BY shipment_id
) e ON a.shipment_id = e.shipment_id
   AND a.shipment_date = e.earliest_date;



Here I am using an Inner Join to join a table and a sub query
First give the columns identifieers from a join
Then give the table an identifier
Here I began my sub query-
  I first identified my columns of shipment ID and earliest shipment date with the MIN function
  From in my sub query does not need an idenfifier
  Group by in sub query does not need an idenfifier 
End your sub query statement with a closed parenthesis and small idenfifier
State the ON values to watch for in each identifier, normally here you are using JOIN to join two tables but here you need to note the identifiers of the sub queries
since you have two columns you need to note the identifiers on both columns
