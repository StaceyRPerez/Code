#🔍 Practice Problem 1:
Tables:

orders(order_id, customer_id, order_date, product_id, revenue)

products(product_id, product_name, category)

Task:
Write a SQL query to return each product category, the number of orders, and the total revenue generated. Only include categories that have at least one order. Sort the result by total revenue in descending order.






SELECT 
     p.category,
     SUM(o.revenue) AS total_revenue_generated,
     COUNT(o.order_id) AS number_of_orders
FROM orders o
JOIN products p
     ON o.product_id = p.product_id
GROUP BY p.category
HAVING SUM(o.revenue) > 0
ORDER BY total_revenue_generated DESC;


HAVING and SUM need both together
