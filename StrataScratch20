Write a query to return all Customers (cust_id) who are violating primary key constraints in the Customer Dimension (dim_customer) i.e. those Customers who are present more than once in the Customer Dimension.
For example if cust_id 'C123' is present thrice then the query should return two columns, value in first should be 'C123', while value in second should be 3









SELECT
    cust_id,
    COUNT(*) AS occurrence_count
FROM
    dim_customer
GROUP BY
    cust_id
HAVING
    COUNT(*) > 1;



The request is asking for customer Ids in one column and how many times they come up in the second column. You need to group by customer ID
and also only include customer who show up more than once they are the ones who are violating the primary key constraints
COUNT is always in parenthesis for the asterik
