#Write a query that returns the number of unique users per client per month.




SELECT client_id,
    MONTH(time_id) as month
FROM fact_events
GROUP BY client_id,
    MONTH(time_id);





Since the ask if calling for client, the client is in the "client_id" column so that is where we 
are selecting data from and want to return
MONTH is also being asked to be returned so we can use the MONTH formula which would need to be
extracted from (time_id) and we want to take the month away from it only and since the whole
date is mondy, day, and year, we need to denote the "as month" to just include that 
FROM is the table
The ask is asking that client is grouped for each month but not just the month we also
need to group the client as well so we write GROUP BY client_id, 
MONTH(time_id); There does not need to be any where since there is no filtering
