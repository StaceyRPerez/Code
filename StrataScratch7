#Write a query that will calculate the number of shipments per month. 
#The unique key for one shipment is a combination of shipment_id and sub_id.
#Output the year_month in format YYYY-MM and the number of shipments in that month.




SELECT COUNT(shipment_id),
    DATE_FORMAT(shipment_date, '%Y-%m') date_ym
FROM amazon_shipment
GROUP BY date_ym;





We want the number of shipments so we need to add "COUNT"
The date needs to be represented in a specific format as the question is asking. 
In this case we can use DATE_FORMAT then extract it from the date, to represent it in the format asking YYYY-MM we use:
'%Y-%m'
we leave the category title at the end of the line how we want it
FROM is normal
GROUP BY is how we designated the date earlier
