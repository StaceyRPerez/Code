#How many customers placed an order and what is the average order amount?




SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) AS total_customers,
    AVG(amount) AS average_order_amount
FROM postmates_orders;




#here they only are askig for two columns with one and one result I don't need to use WHERE or any filters, I will be using SELECT for the majority of this
SELECT is used to use custoemr_id and rename it to the total amount of custoers but I HAVE to put in COUNT (DISTINCT) because the customer IDS are all different
so I need it
AVG make sure i am not using extra spaces from formulas to their ask plugged in number
FROM is implied
