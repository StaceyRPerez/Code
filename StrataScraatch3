#Calculate the average score for each project, but only include projects where more than one team member has provided a score.

#Your output should include the project ID and the calculated average score for each qualifying project.




#Incorrect Code: SELECT project_id, 
    AVERAGE score
FROM project_data,
WHERE team_member_id > 1;


#Reasoning: 
No need for comma after project_data
Average is actually written out as "AVG" you need to have anything for a calculation in parenthesis
The average function line should read as AVG(score) as average_score that way it will show up as an average score. Currently
there is no average score column so you need to make a new column
ANY calculation needs to be in caps
also when you represent an "as" whatever you want it to be titled does not need to be in single quotation marks
The WHERE filter is not necessarily needed because you are better off using the GROUP BY and HAVING functions, It should
look something like this
GROUP BY project_id
HAVING COUNT(team_member_id) > 1; while one would normally read that as including team member IDS who show up more than once but
since we are grouping by Project ID and not Team Member ID then the function is then returning projects and which ones have more
than one team member in their team so the correct code should look something like this: 


SELECT project_id, 
  AVG(score) AS average_score
FROM project_data
GROUP BY project_id, 
HAVING COUNT(team_member_id) >1;
