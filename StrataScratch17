#Count how many claims submitted in December 2021 are still pending. A claim is pending when it has neither an acceptance nor rejection date.




SELECT COUNT(*) AS n_claims
FROM cvs_claims
WHERE MONTH(date_submitted) = 12
  AND YEAR(date_submitted) = 2021
  AND date_accepted IS NULL
  AND date_rejected IS NULL




SELECT is going to prefer * over SELECT COUNT DISTINCT because each column on the reference table implies
that there are no duplicacte rows and so * is preferrable we don't need to use DISTINCT in this case
FROM is straightforward
WHERE MONTH & YEAR is straightforward
Include the NULL function for both accepted and rejected because it represents no information
